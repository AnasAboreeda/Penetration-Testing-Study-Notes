# Computer and Network Hacker Exploits

## General Trends

### How to make money on malicious code

- Sell the code for backdoors/bots
- Spam and web-based advertising
- Pump and dump stock schemes
- Phishing: e-mail, phone, and targeted (spear) phishing
- Denial of Service extortion
- Keystroke loggers stealing financial information
- Rent out armies of infected systems for all of the above
- RAM scrapers pulling CC numbers of POS terminals

### Software Distro-Site Attacks

- Hack into web and FTP sites and alter software to include backdoor ==> Everyone who downloads and uses the tool is impacted

- Another approach is embodied in ISR-Evilgrade tool
  - Listens for software to request update
  - Sends response with malware
  - Currently includes modules for Java browser plug-ins, Winzip, WinAmp, MacOS X, OpenOffice, iTunes, Linkedln toolbar, and more More than 6o software packages in total whose Internet updates can be subverted this way

### Software Distro-Site Defenses

- Check hashes across multiple mirrors
  - Check both MD5 and SHA-1 at least
  - Md5sum and sha1sum are built into Linux
  - Md5summer is available for free for Windows (md5summer.org)
  - Md5deep is another good project at http //md5deepsourceforge.net/
    - Calculates MD5, SHA-;, SHA-256, Tiger, and Whirlpool hashes
    - Available for Win and Linux/UNIX
  - RIPEMD-160
- Check PGP signatures if available
  - Make sure you check against a trustworthy key
- Don’t put new software directly into production; test first

## Reconnaissance



### DNS and nslookup

-  The Domain Name System is full of useful information about a target
• The attacker?s goal is to discover as many IP addresses associated with the target domain as possible
• The nslookup command can be used to interact with a DNS server to get this data
